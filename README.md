A attendance taking app using bluetooth.

The app scans for the student devices using bluetooth, the student have to rename there device bluetooth name to a format **Roll Number_Section_Name**

So if you are thinking that using this student can fake the attendance for there friends, I have already implemented security measures.

App does add devices which is already been added and check there mac address for keeping track.
